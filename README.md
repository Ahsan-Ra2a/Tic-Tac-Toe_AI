### Objectives
Our project is to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using C language. It mainly consists of developing and implementing a AI that plays Tic Tac Toe against another player.
In order to understand what Tic Tac Toe game is and how to play the game, below is the description.
### Description
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game (one of them being played by AI or other player). In this game, there is a board with 3 x 3 squares.
The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The goal of Tic Tac Toe game is to be one of the players to get three same symbols in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally on a 3 x 3 grid. The player who first gets 3 of his/her symbols (marks) in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game, and the other loses the game. The game can be played by two players. There are two options for players: 
(a) Player VS Player
(b) Player VS AI
